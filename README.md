Blackjack, also known as 21, is a casino card game where players aim to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, competing against the dealer rather than other players. In this game, both the player and the dealer receive two cardsâ€”with the dealer typically showing only one card initiallyâ€”and players can choose to "hit" to receive additional cards or "stand" to keep their current total. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, face cards count as 10, and aces can be valued at either 1 or 11 depending on which benefits the hand more; achieving an ace and a 10-value card in the initial deal is considered a blackjack and often results in a higher payout. Once players complete their turns, the dealer reveals the hidden card and must hit until reaching at least 17, with the outcome determined by whose hand is closer to 21 without busting.
